Create a new interface called 'Streamable' with the following methods:
    stream()
    getFilesize()
    getRequiredBufferLength()
    getType

Implement the interface in at least two classes(I used the classes 'Audio' and 'Video')
To check if your program does what it should, create a 'Streamer' class which creates a new Instance of the two classes and calls their new Methods
